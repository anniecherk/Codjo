# Codjo

[Leo](https://github.com/leotrs) and I are organizing weekly educational coding challenges for RC Start folks. Each week I'll gather the participants and put them into pairs. I'll find a challenge that seems like it will offer good learning opportunities, and we'll practice:

- Collaborating
- Algorithm problem solving
- Optimizing your algorithm
- Writing clean code

And at the end of the week we'll do a live code-review session and try to learn as much as we can from each other.

Join the #codjo channel in RC Start Slack and come learn with us.
