# Codjo

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/k1t1bGF.jpg" />

[Leo](https://github.com/leotrs) and I are organizing weekly educational coding challenges for [RC Start](https://www.recurse.com/blog/99-free-one-on-one-mentorship-for-new-programmers) folks. Each week we'll gather the participants and put them into pairs. I'll find a challenge that seems like it will offer good learning opportunities, and we'll practice:

- Collaborating
- Algorithm problem solving
- Optimizing your algorithm
- Writing clean code

And at the end of the week we'll do a live code-review session and try to learn as much as we can from each other.
