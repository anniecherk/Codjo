# Binary Search

Yes, binary search! That's the key to this problem. I strongly recommend that before you Google for it and find code examples, you try to implement it based off of this explanation:

> At each step, the algorithm compares the median value in the search space to the target value. Based on the comparison and because the sequence is sorted, it can then eliminate half of the search space. By doing this repeatedly, it will eventually be left with a search space consisting of a single element, the target value.

Try to work out the code for this. If you still can't get it, check this out:
