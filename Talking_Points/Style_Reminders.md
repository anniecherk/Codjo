**I believe that code should be as predictable as possible.**

I've made a lot of similar style suggestions during the code reviews, and everything that I've said aims at predictability. First I'll reiterate what I've said about spacing and logic in regards to code style, and then I'll show some specific examples of refactoring we did.

Spacing
----

Code is easier to read when it's spaced out. My goal is to space code into visually logical parts, including its inline spacing. [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#code-lay-out) has a lot to say about this.

For example, I think that inline spacing should be consistent throughout the code. One of the code snippets below has this line...

```
right = lst[-1-index]
```

...and then later it has this line

```
right = lst[-1 - index]
```

You should maintain the same habits throughout your code. That makes it more predictable.

Logic
----

All things equal, your code should be have a logical flow to it. If you're parsing an array, start with the left side and move to the right. If you're declaring the three variables, `low`, `mid`, and `high`, declare them in that order.

Here's an example from one of the code snippets below. It begins by initalizing these variables:

```python
max_value = len(array)
min_value = 0
```

This'll make me sound super fussy, but I think it reads more logically to _first_ declare the `min_value` and _then_ declare the `max_value`:

```python
min_value = 0
max_value = len(array)
```

About 15 years ago I read the annotated version of the first three _Dragonlance_ books. One of the annotations made a point that's stuck with me, and it's relevant here. They said that a science fiction writer can create anything, any kind of world, and so they have a responsibility to balance their invented concepts with regular, terrestrial concepts so as to not overload the reader.

We have the same responsibility. Have I said it too many times already? You want your code to be as predictable as possible:

[...] As I talked about in '[Applying neuroscience to software development](http://chrismm.com/blog/how-to-use-your-full-brain-when-writing-code/)', when people have to digest your piece of code, their 'mental stack' fills up and it is hard to make progress." <br/> â€•[Writing Good Code: how to reduce the cognitive load of your code](http://chrismm.com/blog/writing-good-code-reduce-the-cognitive-load/) by Christian Maioli Mackeprang

Alright, I've said my piece. Here are some examples.


**Before**

```python
def length(lst):
    '''Return length of lst containing no duplicates'''
    index = 0
    left = lst[index]
    right = lst[-1-index]
    while left < right:
        index = index +1  # Add a space before the 1
        left = lst[index]
        right = lst[-1 - index]  # Remove these spaces
    return index*2  # Space this out
```

**After**

```python
def length(lst):
    '''Return length of lst containing no duplicates'''
    index = 0
    left = lst[index]
    right = lst[-1-index]

    while left < right:
        index = index + 1
        left = lst[index]
        right = lst[-1-index]

    return index * 2
```

**Before**

```python
def find(target,arr):  # Space after the comma
    size = len(arr)
    if size == 0:
        return -1
    mid = size//2  # Space this out
    hi = size-1  # Space this out
    lo = 0
    while target != arr[mid] and lo <= hi:
        if target < arr[mid]:
            hi = mid - 1
            mid = (hi+lo) // 2  # Space out the addition
        if target > arr[mid]:
            lo = mid + 1
            mid = (hi+lo) //2  # Space out the addition
    if target == arr[mid]:
        return mid
    else:
        return -1
```

**After**

```python
def find(target, arr):
    size = len(arr)
    if size == 0:
        return -1

    mid = size // 2
    hi = size - 1
    lo = 0

    while target != arr[mid] and lo <= hi:
        if target < arr[mid]:
            hi = mid - 1
            mid = (hi + lo) // 2

        if target >  arr[mid]:
            lo = mid + 1
            mid = (hi + lo) // 2

    if target == arr[mid]:
        return mid
    else:
        return -1
```

**Before**

```python
def binary_search(element, lst):
    max_index = len(lst)
    min_index = 0

    while True:
        pointer = (max_index - min_index)//2 + min_index
        if lst == []:
            return -1
        elif lst[pointer] == x:
            return pointer
        elif abs(max_index - min_index) <= 1: #we've run out of list to check!
            return -1
        elif lst[pointer] > x:
            max_index = pointer
        elif lst[pointer] < x:
            min_index = pointer
```

**After**

```python
def find(x, listy):
    min_index = 0
    max_index = len(listy)

    while min_index < max_index:
        pointer = (min_index + max_index) // 2

        if listy[pointer] == x:
            return pointer

        elif listy[pointer] > x:
            max_index = pointer

        else:
            min_index = pointer

    return -1
```
