# Let's talk!

I want to maintain a dialogue about what we're trying to improve about the Codjo because, like all things RC, it's an experiment.

Here are a few things I'd like to improve.

Test Cases
----

During the code review for Problem2 (12 August 2016) it became apparent that I need to write better test cases. One idea for improving this was to appeal to all of you. While you're working on your code, if you come up with a test case that breaks your code, and it's one that I'm not testing for, please let me know! PM me, make a pull-request, anything. I want to have harder, better test cases.

This is a bit backwards, I realize. Ideally my test cases would cover all of the corner cases in order to catch your code's shortcomings. My test cases ought to improve the quality of your code, in other words. Instead I'm asking you to use your code to help me improve the quality of my test cases. And at the end of the day, my test cases only matter insofar as they help you improve your code.

So it's imperfect. As things stand, though, my test cases are far from perfect, and I'm imagining that by crowd-sourcing some of the test writing we can improve the overall quality of everyone's code. One of you will think of a test that helps all of us.


Code Review
----

It's clearly been very hard for us to all coordinate our schedules for these weekly reviews. I don't have any perfect solutions, but I have some ideas I want to put out there in case they inspire anything.

#### Recorded Sessions

I've considered the idea of recording our code reviews and putting them on YouTube, pending your permission of course. This way people that aren't able to make it could at least listen and watch at their convenience.

Pros:
- People can watch at any time
- Video archive

Cons:
- Feeling like you're on camera
- My computer might not be able to handle everything

#### Relay Group Sessions

We could schedule a review for Friday and Saturday each week, and one or two people volunteer to be present at both sessions in order to relay information from the first session to the second session.

Pros:
- More options to fit your schedule

Cons:
- 1+ person has to commit to two sessions each week
- We intentionally split the group up

#### Relay Pairing Sessions

People who are able to attend the code review could pair with people who weren't able to attend it in order to relay information.

Pros:
- More pairing

Cons:
- It's unrealistic due to scheduling I think. It's already hard for people to coordinate pairing.
