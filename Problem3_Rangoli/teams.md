# Teams

I haven't assigned anyone to teams. Instead I've listed those who have confirmed that they're participating. I thought maybe we would try an experiment where we let y'all coordinate pairing/coding sessions as you're able.

I'm worried that this might discourage people from making time to pair, where I think pairing is really valuable.

On the other hand, maybe it'll be easier to pair "on the fly", and not have to worry about trying to make it work with one specific person.

So, let's give it a try? What do you all think?

For this to work you should:

- Post on Slack when you're bored and looking to work on it, and see if anyone has time to pair.
- Also post on Slack if you're having trouble coordinating with anyone, and someone will make a point of pairing with you.
- Try to make time to pair with people that are struggling to find a partner.
